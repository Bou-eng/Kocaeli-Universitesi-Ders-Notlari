00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,780
Hi, I'm Jonas

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:05,779
Do you know what open source is?

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:07,779
Well, let me explain it for you

4
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:11,879
Basically, it means that the recipe, of any given work

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,600
is shared and free for anybody to use

6
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,420
Let me take you back where it all started

7
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,280
In the 1880's

8
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:23,500
A guy named Richard Stallmann had a problem with the software in his printer

9
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,840
He could fix the printer himself

10
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:31,119
But unfortunately, he was not allowed to get inside "the black box" by the manufacturer

11
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:35,519
This frustration was the beginning of the Free and Open Source movements

12
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:39,220
The essential benefits of Open Source are:

13
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:42,740
Access to the source, or recipe, of any given work

14
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,180
Free remix and redistribution of any given work

15
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:48,880
An end to predatory vendor lock-in

16
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:51,599
And a higher degree of cooperation

17
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:55,880
Open Source is originally a software related term

18
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,080
- but let's take a nontechnical example of where

19
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,000
the open source mindset is actually used today

20
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,160
Here's Dave

21
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,320
He is a really passionate skateboarder

22
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:09,360
He loves the community because everyone share tips and tricks, openly

23
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:14,660
This means that everybody has access to the source of becoming a better skateboarder

24
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:20,060
Dave has the opportunity of remixing an existing trick and making it even better

25
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,400
He becomes more skilled, faster

26
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,780
If Dave's skateboard breaks

27
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:28,240
he doesn't necessarily have to go back to the vendor to get it fixed

28
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,039
He can also fix it himself with the help of one of his friends from the community

29
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:35,720
This is because the design of the skateboard is Open Source

30
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:40,560
In the skateboard community you share new ideas and remix each others tricks

31
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,680
You cooperate and reach much higher standards than any skateboarder could reach alone

32
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,839
Now, let's take another example

33
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,500
Here's Susan and Michael

34
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,660
They have just bought a new property and now need a new house

35
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,640
John is an Open Source architect

36
00:01:55,780 --> 00:02:00,000
and offers three designs that Susan and Michael can base their dream house on

37
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:03,940
They choose option A, because it best fits their needs

38
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:07,100
But Susan wants a conservatory as well

39
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,340
so Michael draws one

40
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,400
and adds that as an extension to their chosen house design

41
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,520
- option A

42
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:16,060
Susan and Michael choose Company A to help build the house

43
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:19,019
It should be easy for Company A to build it

44
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,980
because the architectural drawings and guidelines are already produced

45
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:25,300
- by John the Open Source architect

46
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,420
But during the process

47
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,060
Susan and Michael find out

48
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:31,799
that Company A's employees are very slow and not very polite

49
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,060
They therefore get Company B to finish the work

50
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,880
It's easy for Company B to take over the project

51
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,920
because everything is openly documented

52
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,160
Fortunately Company B does an amazing job of completing the construction project

53
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,800
In the meantime

54
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:49,880
Koko and Jun have shared a new solar cell design

55
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,120
as an extension to option A as well

56
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,820
Susan and Michael also decide to add that to their home

57
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,780
Susan and Michael are now happy owners of a beautiful and customized new home

58
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,360
But John is also happy

59
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,380
He can now add two new extensions to his professional portfolio

60
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,300
- without having done anything himself

61
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:15,060
So now, I have given you a taste of some of the many benefits of Open Source

62
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,460
But before I leave you

63
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,520
I have to put an end to some of the myths that still exist

64
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:20,859
First

65
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,980
You have no control over your work

66
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,640
That's not true

67
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:28,040
As the initiator, John - the Open Source architect

68
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:32,540
verifies extensions and chooses what can be added to his specific project

69
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,740
and therefore also decides where the project is heading

70
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,200
Second

71
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:40,060
Open = Unsafe

72
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,340
Not true

73
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,299
In an Open Source project

74
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,700
many people are involved

75
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,380
and cooperate to make an even safer product

76
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,880
and to keep unauthorized people out

77
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:51,440
And third

78
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,140
Everything is free

79
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,000
No

80
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,760
the source itself is free and publicly available

81
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,700
but the house must, for example, still be built, customized, maintained

82
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,340
and provided with water, power and heat

83
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:07,940
Hopefully, you can now better understand the positive term; Open Source

84
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,240
and the principles within

85
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,200
Please, start opening up

86
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,020
and use the extreme beneficial principles

87
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,480
the way they deserve

88
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,480
As mentioned, my name is Jonas

89
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,560
and I'm representing BIT BLUEPRINT

90
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,540
We have, in collaboration with Moving Monday, made this video

91
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:27,240
to help scale the positive principles within the Open Source paradigm

92
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,360
We have, of course, made this video free for everyone

93
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,300
to use, modify and share

94
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,740
- so feel free to do that

95
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,240
Thanks for watching!
